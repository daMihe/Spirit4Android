Changelog for Spirit4Android

Planned for future (priority from top to bottom)
- Add Spare-Time

Version 0.6.2
- Fixed Bug: Group was not saved.

Version 0.6.1
- Fixed version 0.6: There were several errors while pushing it to github. I had
  to rewrite more or less all changes of 0.6.
- Multilanguaged the app. All texts, which are displayed by the app, are now
  available in english, too. News and names of events cannot be translated.

Version 0.6
- Bug fixed: When selecting a song for alarm, the selection was changed when the
  settings were opened again.
- System changed: News are now saved in a database. This is faster and allows to
  create a news-filter.
- Feature added: News-filter added (filter will be the same like the schedule-
  semester)
- UI changed: News are now sorted by creation-date.
- UI changed: The main-screen does now show countdown and news even in landscape
  mode on small screens.
- UI changed: The song for alarm can only be changed if alarm is activated.
- System changed: More or less the complete app is ready for i18n (most of used
  texts are now located in the android-resources, which allows multi-languaged
  apps)
- Fixed Bug: Alarm does not ring, if app is used between 0:00 and first event on
  the same day.
- System changed: Schedule and Groups are now saved in the database, too. This
  should improve the speed of the app dramatically, even on slow phones.

Version 0.5
- Implemented a Alarm-Clock with penetrant mode (optional)
- Added Build-Numbers
- Language-dependent strings are now located as Android-ressources (currently
  only a small part)

Version 0.4
- Long black-screen at launch (appears only if there is no internet connection
  or spirit is offline) removed
- Update will be tried now only  once a day.

Version 0.3
- written new schedule-parser, now currently running events are displayed too
- changed countdown and schedule view. Now all events at the next day are 
  visible and it's now possible to browse the schedule.
- changed icon
